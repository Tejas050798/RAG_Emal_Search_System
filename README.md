# HelpMateAI | Email Search System

This project provides an AI-assisted solution for intelligently searching through email content. It involves loading, cleaning, and preparing email data using custom regular expressions and processing techniques, aimed at enabling efficient querying or modeling.

## 📁 Project Overview

Emails are often messy, containing redundant headers, inline attachments, and broken formatting. This notebook demonstrates a system to clean and prepare these emails, making them suitable for advanced processing tasks such as classification, semantic search, or retrieval-augmented generation.

### ✅ Key Steps Covered

- 📦 Importing essential Python libraries
- 🧾 Loading and merging email datasets
- 🧹 Cleaning email content using regex
- 🔍 Removing email headers, quoted text, and system noise
- 🧠 Preparing the dataset for downstream ML/NLP tasks

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run all cells sequentially to see the data import, cleaning, and preparation steps.
